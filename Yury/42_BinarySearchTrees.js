    Difficulty: Tricky    

    Someone used the Linked List you made previously, but they accidentally made one of the items link back to an earlier part of the list. As a result, the list canâ€™t be traversed properly because it loops infinitely.

    Your job is to write a function that accepts your linked list as its parameter, and returns the node at the start of the loop, i.e. the one that is linked back to.

    Samples:
    You can simulate a looped list with this code.
    let list = new LinkedList();
    let previousNode  = null;
    let linkBackNode  = null;
    let linkBackPoint = Math.round(Math.random() * 1000);

    for (let i = 1; i < 1000; i ++) {
        let node = new LinkedListNode(i);

        if (i == linkBackPoint) {
            linkBackNode = node
        }

        if (previousNode) {
            let predecessor = previousNode;
            predecessor.next = node;
        } else {
            list.start = node;
        }

        previousNode = node;
    }

    previousNode.next = linkBackNode;

    list.findLoopStart() == linkBackNode
